## Datastore2Mongo

### What is it?
   It's a simple CLI tool to migrate the dataset from the Google Cloud Datastore to MongoDB. It can work either on auto mode or manual mode based on the choice given to the tool.In manual mode, it generates a migration script that needs to be executed manually. You might need to change the script to support authentication with mongodb. Current release of the app does not support any authentication mechanism in Auto mode. 
### Installation
